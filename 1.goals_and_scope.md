# 1. Goals and Scopes

The goal of Database Mesh is to build a unified governance framework for databases in cloud native environments, help build better governance experience for developers and operators.

For example, developes don't need to know every detail of the database deployment, they care about the data type and schema in the business perspective. Database Mesh could help simplify this prodedure. 

Another example, for DBA or SRE, even they know different database comes with different deployment requirements and operation characteristics, there still some common actions could be derived and concluded. No matter it's MySQL or Redis, applications need to access them with a high availability endpoint, horizontally traffic splitting and sharding is also needed in most cases. Other aspects like security, audit, access control and observability are helpful too.

Database Mesh focus on governance of databases and all of the design proposal should be related to this. Topics not included:
* Orchestrator
* Container Runtime
